We designed a Wizard-of-Oz experimental setup, which involves a complex process. Due to the limitations of IPA technology, it cannot recognize sign language. There is currently no sign language recognition technology available that facililates two-way communication. For a year and a half, we conducted two separate study phases involving deaf users interacting with IPAs within a home setting. One phase focused on the living environment, while the other focused on the kitchen environment. The aim of the project is to investigate how deaf users prefer to interact with IPAs.

<summary>SignMates Matchmaking App</summary>
Many matchmaking apps prioritize serving their mainstream users, often overlooking marginalized communities in the process. They often lack disability or accessibility features, and there is a severe scarcity of user research aimed at designing for the needs of marginalized users. Many marginalized users hesitate to disclose their identity due to societal norms that predominately favor those who are hearing and able-bodied.  

My project specifically targeted two groups: deaf users who have previously used a matchmaking app and hearing users who have met or would like to meet a deaf person through a matchmaking app. We designed a deaf friendly matchmaking app tailored to the needs of the deaf community aiming to challenge societal norms and help deaf users feel more confident when connecting with others through such platforms.
