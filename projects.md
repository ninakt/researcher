## Juno Awards 2024 Accessibility Report 

My business partner and I collaborated with [CBC Music](https://www.cbc.ca/music) to evaluate the accessibility of the Juno Awards 2024 event. This report describes the conformance of the event with the Accessible Canada Act (ACA), W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), and EN 301 549. 

In the review process, conformance evaluation of accessibility for hosting a live event requires manual assessment by an experienced reviewer(s). The accessibility support baseline is AA conformance level per the evaluation criteria based on [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/). We evaluated that the Juno Awards 2024 event seems to adhere to WCAG 2.2 AA standards.
