## About Nina Tran

<img class="profile-picture" src="prof_pic.jpg">

She uses she/her/they pronouns. She is Deaf. She was born to her first-generation immigrant parents who could not afford education. They tried their hardest to help her and her sister succeed by any means, even if they lacked access to resources. When she moved to the United States of America, she never knew that she could go to a public school and learn sign language. That's when her world expanded. 

Fast forward to the present, she has a bachelor's degree in Disability Studies and Informatics from the University of Washington. She recently received her master's degree in Accessible Human-centered Computing from Gallaudet University.Her younger self would not believe that all of this could have happened. 

She has always been enquiring and enjoyed learning about the world. She is passionate about accessibility. With that in mind, she brings over 4 years of hands-on experience in research, encompassing qualitative and quantitative methodologies, statistical analysis, accessibility testing, and expertise in UX/UI. 

## Research Interest

Accessibility, Human-Computer Interaction, Smart Home Technology & Automation, Gaming, Assistive Technology, Product Development, AI Ethics, and how API can be applied to sign language technology.
